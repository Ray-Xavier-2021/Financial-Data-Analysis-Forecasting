# My Financial Data Analysis and Forecasting Project

## Introduction
Welcome to my Financial Data Analysis and Forecasting project. In this endeavor, I'll be immersing myself in financial data, crafting informative visualizations, constructing a dynamic Profit and Loss (P&L) Statement dashboard, and crafting a financial forecasting model.

## Project Details
This project divides into three distinct tasks, each offering a unique window into the realm of financial data:

## Tasks

### Task 1: Data Analysis and Visualization
**a. Identifying My Question**: I'll kick off by identifying a question pertaining to the financial data. My question should involve at least one categorical variable (e.g., GICS Sector or GICS Sub Industry) and one quantitative variable (a financial metric). The question should necessitate the use of summary statistics.
  - Categorical: GICS Sub Industry
  - Quantitative: Total Revenue

**b. Data Analysis**: I'll conduct my data analysis employing spreadsheet software and present the outcomes through a slide presentation. This will include providing summary statistics, such as measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median) and measures of spread (standard deviation and range) that fortify my answer.

**c. Visualization**: In my slide presentation, I'll ensure the inclusion of at least one visualization, be it a bar chart, histogram, scatterplot, or box-plot. This visualization will effectively underscore my findings and insights derived from the summary statistics.

**Deliverables**: My submission will comprise the slide presentation and a spreadsheet with a dedicated tab for Summary statistics.

### Task 2: Profit and Loss Statement Dashboard
I'll embark on the creation of a dynamic dashboard for a Profit and Loss (P&L) Statement. This dashboard will adeptly compute Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) for a company of my choice, selected from a user-friendly drop-down list. The drop-down list will fetch historical fundamentals data for the chosen company, encompassing data for all available years.

**Deliverable**: The output of this task will be a spreadsheet featuring a tab devoted to the Dynamic P&L Statement.

### Task 3: Financial Forecasting Model
Shifting my focus, I'll fashion a financial forecasting model for a distinct company (different from Task 2), prognosticating Gross Profit, Operating Profit, or EBIT for two additional years. I'll engineer this model to encompass three diverse scenarios: Best case, Weak case, and Base case. To provide a comprehensive outlook, I'll adjust assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin, and operating margin for each scenario.

**Deliverable**: The culmination of this task will be a spreadsheet inclusive of a tab designated for the Forecasting Model.
